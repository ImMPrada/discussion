all of theme use Password1! as password ( better yet: as secret word xD )

## CORS Policy
On development, the backend will only accept requests from another localhost port instance if sent from a browser, otherwise the request will fail due to the current CORS Policy

## Usage
This project is a frontend. Following the setup steps, you'll get the project running at http://localhost:3000.
